# ActionStats
GoLang Action Stats, Technical Challenge for JumpCloud

```
This is a library for Go Language designed to meet the specs of the JumpCloud Technical Challenge
Assumptions: Intended to be run on a Windows/Mac/Linux Computer with Go SDK 1.16rc1 installed.
```

## Installation

Installation is done by adding the 'ActionStats' directory to your GoLang path. Once added to your path, it can be referenced by any project. 
To run the included tests, download and extract the zip. Navigate to the 'TestCases' directory in a Command Prompt/Terminal, and execute:
```
go build

TestCases.exe /* For Windows */
./TestCases /* For Mac/Linux */
```

For repeated testing purposes, I've added a 'Reset' method to ActionStats to allow you to test repeatedly with fresh results.

## Side Notes
It may have been silly, but when I learned that your primary programming language is Go, I was determined to achieve this task in that language. *Even though I had 0 experience with Go before today*. Thank you for your time and consideration!
